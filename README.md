## Introduction

Anemia Detection is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of anemia in individuals based on their medical data. The project leverages various algorithms to provide accurate predictions, which can assist in early detection and management of anemia.

## Features

- **Early Detection:** Helps in identifying potential anemia cases early.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive form-based input for easy data entry.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides insights through graphical representations of the data.

## Technologies Used

- **Scikit-learn**: Building and training machine learning models.
- **CatBoost**: Handling categorical features and boosting model performance.
- **Pandas** & **NumPy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization and analysis.
- **Pickle**: Serializing and saving machine learning models.
- **Flask**: Backend web framework.
- **HTML/CSS** & **Bootstrap**: Frontend development.
- **Render**: Deployment platform.
- **VSCode**: Development environment.
- **Miniconda**: Managing the development environment.

## Project flow
- User interacts with the UI to enter the input. 
- Entered input is analyzed by the model which is integrated. 
- Once the model analyses the input the prediction is showcased on the UI. 

To accomplish this,I have completed all the activities listed below: 
- Data Collection & Preparation  
- Collect the dataset 
- Data Preparation 
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Descriptive statistical 
- Visual Analysis 
- Model Building 
- Training the model in multiple algorithms 
- Performance Testing & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Testing model with multiple evaluation metrics 
- Comparing model accuracy before & after applying hyperparameter tuning 
- Model Deployment 
- Save the best model 
- Integrate with Web Framework
